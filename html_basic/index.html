    <h3>My Journey into Web Development</h3>

    <!-- Paragraphs -->
    <p>Hello! My name is Taiwo Afusat. This is my first official webpage, and I’m excited to share it with the world.</p>
    <p>I am currently learning how to build websites using HTML, CSS, and more advanced technologies in the future.</p>
    <p>This project is part of my ALX journey, where I’m building my skills one step at a time.</p>
    <p>Stay tuned as I continue to improve and add more features!</p>
